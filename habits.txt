I think physical activity is very important for programmers.
If they won´t exercise enough, their bodies will deteriorate.

The second habit - get it done attitude - is about shipping a product
although it isn´t done yet, but users can use it. Fixing bugs or 
adding other functionalities will be delivered next time.

The third habit - keep it simple - keep code simple as possible, 
it is going to help me prevent making bugs and make my code readable
for me and other programmers too.

The fourth habit - zone - Be in the zone is time, when a programmer is
productive for longer period of time, for example 3 hours without 
interruption.

The fifth habit - always learn - Programmers should always learn new
things about programming languages, how to better debug.
